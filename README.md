# SimpleTaskList
Basic task list using vanilla JavaScript: add, remove, filter, store and remove from local memory.  HTML does use font awesome icons for the delete task icons.  Additonally, styling elements imported from cloudfire/materialize.  I did this as a short project to improve my understanding of core javaScript functionality.
